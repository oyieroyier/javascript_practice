# CLASSES

Objects do not exist in a vaccum. They always tend to borrow some properties from other objects.
Think of humans in general. We have some general features such as a name, age, date of birth, residence, the ability to think, see, walk etc.
Now, think of a student. As a human being, a student ordinarily has all these features of a human being listed above, alongside some student-specific ones; such as the name of the school they go to, the subjects they do, their crrent grade, their enrollment year, their student number etc.

When defining a `student` object, we could write all these properties they have as follows:

```ts
let student: {
	name;
	age;
	dateOfBirth;
	residence;
	canThink;
	canSee;
	canWalk;
	nameOfSchool;
	subjectsTaken;
	currentGrade;
	enrollmentYear;
	studentNumber;
};
```

Now, assume we have a teacher who, also being a human being shares all the attributes of a human being listed above alongside teacher-specific ones such as place of work, subjects taught, previous place of work, employee number, specialization.

We could again define a `teacher` object as follows:

```ts
let teacher: {
	name;
	age;
	dateOfBirth;
	residence;
	canThink;
	canSee;
	canWalk;
	placeOfWork;
	subjectsTaught;
	previousEmployer;
	employeeNumber;
	specialization;
};
```

Now, we have a Software Engineer who on top of the human attributes has developer-specific ones such as their preferred programming languages, preferred operating system and preferred text editor.

We could again define a `softwareEngineer` object this way:

```ts
let softwareEngineer: {
	name;
	age;
	dateOfBirth;
	residence;
	canThink;
	canSee;
	canWalk;
	preferredProgrammingLanguages;
	preferredOperatingSystem;
	preferredEditor;
};
```

You may have noticed that each time we defined the objects, we repeated all the human attributes `name`, `age`, `dateOfBirth`, `residence`, `canThink`, `canSee`, `canWalk` for each of the object.
Repetition in coding, especially repeating the same 7 lines thrice, is not good practice.

What if we had one object called `humans` whose attributes the `student`, `teacher` and `softwareEngineer` can all borrow so we keep our code concise?

```ts
let Humans: {
	name;
	age;
	dateOfBirth;
	residence;
	canThink;
	canSee;
	canWalk;
};
```

So that any time we declare the above objects we simply say:

- `student` object

```ts
let student: {
	// Take all attributes from the `Humans` object and add these ones:
	nameOfSchool;
	subjectsTaken;
	currentGrade;
	enrollmentYear;
	studentNumber;
};
```

- `teacher` object

```ts
let teacher: {
	// Take all attributes from the `Humans` object and add these ones:
	placeOfWork;
	subjectsTaught;
	previousEmployer;
	employeeNumber;
	specialization;
};
```

- `softwareEngineer` object

```ts
let softwareEngineer: {
	// Take all attributes from the `Humans` object and add these ones:
	preferredProgrammingLanguages;
	preferredOperatingSystem;
	preferredEditor;
};
```

That is the exact concept of `classes` and inheritance.

## What is a class?

In JavaScript, a class is a set of objects that inherit properties from the same prototype object.

### Classes and Constructors

A constructor is a function designed for the initialization of newly-created objects. They are invoked using the `new` keyword and automatically create the new object.

The `prototype` property of the constructor is used as the prototype of the new object.
All objects created with the same constructor function inherit from the same object and therefore are members of the same class.

Here's an example of a constructor function:

```ts
function Person(name: string, age: number, programmingLanguage: string) {
	this.name = name;
	this.age = age;
	this.programmingLanguage = programmingLanguage;
}
```

First note, because constructor functions initiate classes and by convention classes begin with capital letters, the function name should also begin with a capital letter.

We could add other functionalities to this function by expanding its prototype object. Say, as follows:

```ts
Person.prototype = {
	youthFundQualification: function () {
		return this.age > 35
			? "Sorry, you don't qualify for the Youth Fund"
			: 'You qualify for the Youth Fund';
	},

	yearsToRetirement: function () {
		let result = 65 - this.age;
		return `You have ${result} years left before retirement.`;
	},

	languageChoice: function () {
		return this.programmingLanguage === 'JavaScript'
			? `You have beautiful taste, ${this.name}!`
			: `Do better, ${this.name}!`;
	},
};
```

Now when someone initializes an object using this constructor function:

- The `youthFundQualification` method can use their age to tell them whether the qualify for the Youth Funding.
- The `yearsToRetirement` method also uses their age to tell them how long they have left to work in public service before retirement.
- The `languageChoice` method uses their preferred programming language to tell them if they have a good taste or they should make better choices in life ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.

Now, we can reuse this constructor function on as many instances as we like without repeating code.

Initializing 3 people's objects is as simple as:

```ts
const walter = new Person('Walter', 36, 'Python');
const bob = new Person('Bob', 22, 'JavaScript');
const wendy = new Person('Wendy', 52, 'Ruby');
```

When you log teach of these person's object you will get:

```ts
console.log(walter); // => { name: 'Walter', age: 36, programmingLanguage: 'Python' }
console.log(bob); // => { name: 'Bob', age: 22, programmingLanguage: 'JavaScript' }
console.log(wendy); // => { name: 'Wendy', age: 52, programmingLanguage: 'Ruby' }
```

You don't see the addtional functionality we added to the `Person` constructor function prototype object, but they have been inherited by these object instances and can be accessed by simply calling them.

- `youthFundQuaification()`

```ts
console.log(walter.youthFundQualification());
// => Sorry, you don't qualify for the Youth Fund
console.log(bob.youthFundQualification());
// => You qualify for the Youth Fund
```

- `yearsToRetirement()`

```ts
console.log(wendy.yearsToRetirement());
// => You have 13 years left before retirement.
console.log(walter.yearsToRetirement());
// => You have 29 years left before retirement.
```

- `languageChoice()`

```ts
console.log(bob.languageChoice());
// => You have beautiful taste, Bob!
console.log(wendy.languageChoice());
// => Do better, Wendy!
```

**NOTE**:

- **Remember, if the property is a method, don't forget to invoke it.**
- **Also, the `Function.prototype` convention is mandatory, if you want to add extra functionality to the constructor function's prototype that will be inherited by the class instances. An invocation of the `Person()` constructor automatically uses `Person.prototype` as the prototype of the new `Person` object.**

We do not use arrow function syntax for constructor functions or the pototype methods because arrow functions do not have a prototype property and so can't be used as constructors.

Also, arrow functions inherit the `this` keyword from the context in which they were defined rather than setting it in the object in wich they were invoked. This makes them useless for method invocation.
